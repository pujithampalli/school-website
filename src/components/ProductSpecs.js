      <p>When your child enters the Junior KG, here is where formal education begins and kids are given emphasis on speaking, writing, and advanced mathematics suited for their age. At Rainbow preschool, your child remains motivated to develop his/her own ideas and thoughts, but in kindergarten, these are caste or channelized in focused analysis, with importance on collaborating conceptual understanding.Skills taught are on maths, computers, visual arts, drama, science, languages, arithmetic and more. The curriculum helps kids to become inquirers by thinking critically, making connection and deriving the meaning of world than just observing the same. Kids learn to decide upon the actions they take and practice all writing alphabets in both capital and lowercase, acquaint with alphabetical sounds (phonetics), learn numbers in writing and oral, and compare quantities: less than, greater than etc. Kids can play alphabet games, discover each other through classroom interaction and learn to dictate original stories.</p>
